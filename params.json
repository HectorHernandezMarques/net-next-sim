{"name":"net-next-sim: ns-3 Direct Code Execution with Linux kernel","tagline":"","body":"## Quick start\r\n```\r\n git clone git://github.com/direct-code-execution/net-next-sim.git\r\n cd net-next-sim\r\n make defconfig ARCH=lib\r\n make library ARCH=lib\r\n make testbin -C arch/lib/test\r\n make test ARCH=lib\r\n```\r\nsee what's going on.\r\n\r\n**NOTE**\r\nOld code available at non-default branches (sim-ns3-2.6.36-branch, sim-ns3-3.14.0-branch, etc) use different ARCH name, which is _sim_. You need to replace the above instruction _lib_ to _sim_ (e.g., `make library ARCH=sim` should be used for 2.6.36 branch).\r\n\r\n## What is this ?\r\n_net-next-sim_ is a shared library of Linux (net-next) kernel to integrate with userspace applications, such as ns-3 network simulator. It consists of **sim** architecture (located arch/sim/) to avoid touching the main part of Linux kernel.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Gallery\r\n* [mptcp Linux kernel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN_nv7RdFm8)\r\n* [Mobile IPv6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y790NE3EPCg)\r\n\r\n## More information\r\n* [Wiki](http://yans.pl.sophia.inria.fr/trac/DCE/wiki)\r\n* [Direct Code Execution (DCE) project page](http://www.nsnam.org/overview/projects/direct-code-execution/)\r\n* [Jenkins nightly build/tests](ns-3-dce.cloud.wide.ad.jp/jenkins/)","google":"UA-38745236-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
