It consists of **sim** architecture (located arch/sim/) to avoid touching the main part of Linux kernel.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Gallery\r\n* [mptcp Linux kernel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN_nv7RdFm8)\r\n* [Mobile IPv6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y790NE3EPCg)\r\n\r\n## More information\r\n* [Wiki](http://yans.pl.sophia.inria.fr/trac/DCE/wiki)\r\n* [Direct Code Execution (DCE) project page](http://www.nsnam.org/overview/projects/direct-code-execution/)\r\n* [Jenkins nightly build/tests](ns-3-dce.cloud.wide.ad.jp/jenkins/)\r\n","google":"UA-38745236-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
